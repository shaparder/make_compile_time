# LINFO1252 Projet 1

C programs using multithreading, based on 3 well known problems to study their implementations and performances. The bash and python scripts measure performances.

## Files architecture:
- **srcs** : Contains all the C files to compile.
- **objs** : The folder where object files are going to be created.
- **includes** : Contain the header files for function prototyping, macros and includes.
- **Makefile** : File used to define commands compiling and executing the program.
- **timing** : Scripts handling performance (time-related) measurements.

## Usage:

```
make all
```

```
make time
```
